# React Application Example

The application represents an image gallery.

A user can upload new images using an upload form located at the top of the page. To do that a user has to input an image URI and click the button Submit. The thumbnails of uploaded images are displayed right below the upload form.

To preview any of uploaded images a user has to click the image thumbnail.

**FileSystem API** is used to get access to the user's file system. Each image on the file system is represented as a **BLOB**.
